## Building
To build the project, you will first need to install the necessary dependencies using npm and Bower in the project root to get everything you need.

Run:
```sh
$ npm install & bower install
```

Next, you need to run your local server.
Run:
```sh
$ node server
```

To actually build the project you will need Gulp.
Run:
```sh
$ gulp
```
